# Towers of Hanoi

## About
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Towers of Hanoi game. The game is implemented using a stack-based approach and consists of several Python scripts:

- `node.py`: Defines the Node class used to represent disks in the game.
- `stack.py`: Defines the Stack class used to represent the towers and perform the game operations.
- `script.py`: Main script that executes the Towers of Hanoi game.

The game is a fun and quirky implementation that provides a challenge (partly due to the lack of a UI).

## How to Play
To play the Towers of Hanoi game, run the `script.py` file using Python. Follow the on-screen instructions to move disks between towers and solve the puzzle.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pestopasta74/Towers-of-Hanoi.git

3. Run the game script:
